    Submitted for Computers and Operations Research, 2018.

== Instructions ==

CMake [1] and GCC [2] are required to compile the code.
LEMON [3] library is used for graph manipulation.
LEMON should be installed in a folder where g++ can locate it automatically (depending on your Linux distribution) [4], otherwise the flags to include headers and libraries should be explicited in the compiler command-line invocation (edit 'CMakeLists.txt' file in this case).

$> cmake .
$> make
$> ./psefficiency_experiment <instance_list_file> {-k <num_iterations>}

ex: ./psefficiency_experiment gdb.txt -k 20000
